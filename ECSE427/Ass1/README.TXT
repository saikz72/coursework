1) Error messages:
my shell displays error messages depending on the user's input. If a particular command requires multiple arguments and these requirements are not met, the shell would display a message that's different from when the user inputs an unknown command.

2)Quitting the shell:
A quit in a script would terminate the program as it would when the user manually inserts it in the shell. 

3)Memory capacity: 
The shell's memory is of size 1000 and the shell displays a message when its out of storage.
